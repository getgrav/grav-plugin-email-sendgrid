/**
 * {@see Http} over cURL, with every switch that matters set explicitly.
 *
 * The settings are not defaults and they are not decoration:
 *
 * - **HTTPS only**, on the request and on its redirects. An API key travels in
 *   a header on every one of these calls, and a plain-HTTP hop would put it on
 *   the wire in clear.
 * - **Peer and host verification on.** Off in nobody's build, and worth stating
 *   anyway: this is the class where turning it off would be quiet and bad.
 * - **Two redirects.** Enough for an endpoint that moved, not enough to be
 *   walked around a network.
 * - **A response cap.** SendGrid's largest answer here is a list of an
 *   account's webhooks, which is a few kilobytes. Ten megabytes of anything is
 *   somebody pointing this at a file server, and the write callback stops
 *   reading rather than filling memory.
 * - **Short timeouts.** This runs behind a button a merchant is watching. A
 *   slow API has to become a sentence on a screen quickly, rather than a
 *   request that eventually hits the PHP time limit.
